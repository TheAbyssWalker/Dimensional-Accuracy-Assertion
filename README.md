# Dimensional-Accuracy-Assertion

This is our final year engineering project done in raspberry pi 3.
The project can calculate the dimensions of nut and bolt.
It uses laser triangulation technique for measurement.
For bolt, it can calculate thread pitch, thread height, length and major diameter
For nut, it can calculate thread pitch and diameter.
